### Hi friend, ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) 
Welcome to this profile, it is an honor for me that you come here. I am a software and firmware engineer. I feel passion for developing applications that resolve daily issues of the people. On the other hand, I consider that communication protocols are one of the most interesting things in IOT because they let the machine communicate by themselves without human interaction.<br>

I think that sharing knowledge is the best way to get a better world. So let's start.
